# CAT-OR-DOG !?
A CNN based implementation to classify between cats and dogs. The motive was to become versed with functionings of CNNs and Pytorch.
The architecture included 3 conv, 3 max pool layers and 2 fully connected layers of neurons. Open CV and numpy were used for data preprocessing; Training was extensively done with Pytorch. 
Initial training was done for only 3 epochs, which gave a fine accuracy of 62% on test data. But this can be made more better on training the model for higher number of epochs.
